- Why a new programming language?

Of all new programming languages, it's asked if they bring something new.

This one brings many things.

- It supports features of functional programming languages: immutability, first-class functions.
- Unlike most such languages, it aims to be easy to learn and use. Its syntax mirrors that of an imperative language, which are the most commonly used, and is based on scripting imperative languages specifically, the most user-friendly languages. It's easy to learn and can be used to teach declarative programming principles.
- It supports logic programming features. That is to say, you have Prolog and any of its forgotten features by default that you can activate with a keyword. The language is an attempt to "revive" Prolog. It has many features that Prolog didn't and drops conventions of Prolog that aren't common in languages nowadays.
- Optional type system. Types ensure errors are found before the program is run. If you are going for a more flexible approach, you can at first program without adding any types manually (and the system will still infer types to find errors), though you can add types later.
